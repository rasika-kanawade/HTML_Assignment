HTML
Hypertext markup language- are used for developing web pages(pages that run in browser and 
transported over internet using http protocol)
    HTML is made up of tags that decide how to display the data/content.  HTML plays a fundamental
 role in web development. It serves as the backbone of web pages, providing structure and content to a website.

    HTML allows images, sound, and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It is written in 
the form of elements consisting of "tags" surrounded by angle brackets (<>) within the web page content. It can use 
 in languages such as JavaScript, which affects certain behaviors of the webpage. HTML can also be used to create webpages 
 with the help of CSS, to define the appearance and layout of text and other material without having to directly insert the 
display codes into the HTML document. CSS can also be integrated into the HTML document, so a separate CSS file will not be necessary.
